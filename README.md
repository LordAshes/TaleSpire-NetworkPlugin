# Usage
While this plugin can be used to demonstarte the client-server messaging, the code is only a silly example to demonstrate the easy of use of the Network class. To use it in your own plugin, just copy the single Network.cs file which contains code for both the server, client and common functionality. Then use the Program.cs file to see how easy it is to instanciate and use.
